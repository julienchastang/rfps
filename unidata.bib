  abstract =     {The OGC CF-netCDF data model supports multi-dimensional gridded data and multi-dimensional multi-point data, representing space and time-varying phenomena. In particular, this extension standard is limited to multi-point, and regular and warped grids.

This standard specifies the CF-netCDF data model encoding using the OGC GML 3.2.1 coverage application schema, as well as CF-netCDF data exchange format and protocol encoding.

This standard specifies: (a) the CF-netCDF GML encoding to be used by OGC standards; (b) the CF-netCDF data format exchanged using OGC standards; (c) the Internet protocol characteristics to effectively exchange CF-netCDF data.

As per the GML 3.3. standard, GML 3.3 imports the 3.2 schema. The canonical location of the 3.2 all components schema document for 3.3 is http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.2.1/gml.xsd},

  abstract = {Gamma-ray /`glows/' are long duration (seconds to tens of minutes)
	X-ray and gamma-ray emission coming from thunderclouds. Measurements
	suggest the presence of relativistic runaway electron avalanches
	(RREA), the same process underlying terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.
	Here we demonstrate that glows are relatively a common phenomena
	near the tops of thunderstorms, when compared with events such as
	terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. Examining the strongest glow measured
	by the airborne detector for energetic emissions, we show that this
	glow is measured near the end of a downward RREA, consistent with
	occurring between the upper positive charge layer and the negative
	screening layer above it. The glow discharges the upper positive
	layer by [ge]9.6[thinsp]mA, strong enough to be an important charging
	mechanism of the storm. For this glow, the gamma-ray flux observed
	is close to the value at which relativistic feedback processes become
	important, with an avalanche multiplication factor of 4,500.},
